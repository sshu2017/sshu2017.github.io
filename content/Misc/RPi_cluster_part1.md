This is not a tutorial on how to build Raspberry Pi cluster and install Hadoop/Spark on it at all. This is a **diary** for myself to document the process of tring to build one, failed in the end, and learned lots of new things. 

I have seen many other people built clusters with several Raspberry Pis, ranging from 4 RPis to 100+
